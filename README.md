# jMathTest
Simple programs written in the "J" Programming Language to test various math functions
## Results
When executing some of the included IJS files, no output may be displayed. The output may only be displayed with the REPL, or interactive version of the J console not loading the script.
## If No Output
If the programs do not result in any output, the variables should be set if the scripts are successful.
## More Advanced IJS Files
The more advanced IJS files with variable names longer than one letter are intended for ease of use with the J programming language, particularly by ensuring that the commands more closely resemble approximately their analogous shell commands.
